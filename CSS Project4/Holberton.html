			<h1>Who is Holberton?</h1>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>

			<h2>Holberton School honors the work of Frances Elizabeth "Betty" Snyder Holberton (1917-2001). She was one of the six programmers of the ENIAC – the first programmable, general-purpose electronic digital computer, created in 1943 by the US Army.

Betty Holberton helped create what would later become modern-day software engineering and was involved with the creation and design of the FORTRAN and COBOL programming languages.</h2>
